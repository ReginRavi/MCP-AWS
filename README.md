# MCP Server and Client

This project scaffolds a basic Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and client in Python.

## Files
- `bootstrap.py`: Initializes and runs the MCP server.
- `mcp_server.py`: Contains the MCPServer class.
- `mcp_client.py`: Contains the MCPClient class.
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies.

## Usage
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the server: `python bootstrap.py`
3. Implement client logic in `mcp_client.py` as needed.

## Next Steps
- Add communication logic between server and client.
- Expand server/client features as required.
